# Gitlet
A version control system modeled after Git with features below:
  - Saves backups of directories of files on commit.
  - Restores entire commits or one or more files from previous commits.
  - Creates new branches (sequences of commits) as the user sees fit.
  - Merges changes made in one branch to another.
  - Displays a history of backups.
